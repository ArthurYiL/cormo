# Alpaca
Alpaca is a .NET application development framework that brings [Spring](spring.io) and the "Contexts and Dependency Injection" from JavaEE specifications, specifically its implementation by [JBoss Weld] (http://weld.cdi-spec.org), into .NET development. 

Two main objectives thatAlpaca is trying to achieve:
* Remove ceremonies out of writing code. Alpaca aims to provide an ecosystem of modules that you can pick and plug onto your application to take care of various dirty plumbing works so you don't have to. This is 21st century, with all conveniences in life writing code shouldn't be so hard. You shouldn't need to do anything to setup IoC, ORM, auditing, security, messaging, events, logging, transactions, scheduling, health-monitoring, etc. You should only need to point on the menu and they just happen. [Spring-Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) is a great framework that currently offers such capability, and Alpaca tries to bring it to .NET environment.
