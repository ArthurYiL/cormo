# Alpaca
Alpaca is a .NET application development framework that implements best practices from [Spring](spring.io) and the "Contexts and Dependency Injection" from JavaEE specifications, specifically its implementation by [JBoss Weld] (http://weld.cdi-spec.org). 

Two main objectives that Alpaca is trying to achieve:
* Remove ceremonies out of writing code. Alpaca aims to provide an ecosystem of modules that you can pick and plug onto your application to take care of various dirty plumbing works so you don't have to. This is 21st century, writing code should be easy. You shouldn't need to do anything to setup IoC, ORM, auditing, security, messaging, events, logging, transactions, scheduling, health-monitoring, etc. You should only need to point on the menu and they just happen. [Spring-Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) is a great framework that currently offers such capability, and Alpaca tries to bring it to .NET environment.
